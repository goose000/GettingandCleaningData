# GettingandCleaningData

Getting and Cleaning Data  Course Project

Introduction: in this repository are the elements required by the Getting and Cleaning Data Course project. Below is a summary of the content.

Raw Data: The raw data come from the UCI HARS Data set for machine learning. The files used from this data set are the X, Y, and subject train and test files, as well as the features and activity_labels files.

The script: the included R script uses the UCI HARS Data to produce summary files as described in the codebook. These two files are meansandsds.txt which contains all observations of means and standard deviations, and summarydata.txt which includes the averages of these observations.

The Codebook: the codebook gives a full description of the Rscript, variables used, and the data produced.
